---------------
To create a Python solution for the described AI consultant tasks — focusing on developing custom LLMs for code analysis, vulnerability detection, graph-based data, and integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline — you'll need a comprehensive setup. Below is a detailed Python code structure that addresses the core aspects:
Key Components:

    Fine-tuning Custom LLMs for code analysis and vulnerability detection.
    RAG Pipeline Integration for combining retrieval of relevant data with generative capabilities.
    Benchmarking and Evaluation Automation for model performance assessment.

Libraries and Tools:

pip install torch transformers datasets faiss-cpu langchain scikit-learn

    PyTorch and Transformers for LLM training and fine-tuning.
    Datasets for working with domain-specific datasets (e.g., code vulnerabilities).
    LangChain for creating RAG pipelines.
    Faiss for efficient retrieval of relevant information.
    Scikit-learn for automated evaluation metrics.

1. Fine-Tuning the Model for Code Analysis & Vulnerability Detection

import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load code vulnerability dataset (Assuming it has been pre-processed for code analysis)
dataset = load_dataset("path_to_code_vulnerability_dataset")

# Tokenize data
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['code'], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Fine-tuning the model on code vulnerability data
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test'],
)

trainer.train()

This snippet demonstrates the fine-tuning process of a pre-trained GPT model for a specific dataset related to code vulnerabilities.
2. Integrating RAG Pipeline for Code Vulnerability Retrieval

from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize the FAISS index for vector retrieval
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.load_local("path_to_faiss_index", embeddings)

# Create the retrieval-based QA chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())

# Use the RAG pipeline to fetch relevant information and answer questions
query = "What are the common vulnerabilities in this code?"
answer = qa_chain.run(query)
print(answer)

In this section, we use FAISS (for efficient vector search) and LangChain to build a RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant documents related to code vulnerabilities and uses a language model to generate insights based on that data.
3. Automated Benchmarking and Evaluation of Model Performance

To assess the performance of the fine-tuned model, you can automate evaluation using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or more specialized metrics for code analysis.

from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
import numpy as np

# Define a function to evaluate the model on a validation set
def evaluate_model(predictions, references):
    # Convert predictions and references to binary or categorical output based on the task
    # Assuming it's a classification task for vulnerability detection
    precision = precision_score(references, predictions, average='binary')
    recall = recall_score(references, predictions, average='binary')
    f1 = f1_score(references, predictions, average='binary')

    return precision, recall, f1

# Example: Simulate predictions and ground truth for testing
predictions = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
ground_truth = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 0])

# Evaluate model performance
precision, recall, f1 = evaluate_model(predictions, ground_truth)
print(f"Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1 Score: {f1}")

In this code, we simulate predictions and ground truth for a classification task (e.g., detecting vulnerabilities in code), and then we use precision, recall, and F1 score for evaluation.
4. Automated Benchmarking

To automate model benchmarking, you can set up scripts to run this evaluation periodically, perhaps as part of a CI/CD pipeline for continuous model improvement.

import time

def benchmark_model_periodically(model, eval_data, interval_minutes=30):
    while True:
        predictions = model.predict(eval_data)
        precision, recall, f1 = evaluate_model(predictions, eval_data['labels'])
        print(f"Benchmark - Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1 Score: {f1}")
        
        time.sleep(interval_minutes * 60)

# Trigger periodic benchmarking
benchmark_model_periodically(trainer, tokenized_datasets['validation'])

This function will periodically run model evaluations to track the model's performance over time, ensuring that it stays up-to-date and accurate.
Discussion Topics:

    Fine-tuning Models Combined with RAG:
        Fine-tuning: The model is trained on a domain-specific dataset (code vulnerabilities) to adapt its language and knowledge to the unique structure of the domain.
        RAG Pipeline: By integrating retrieval with generation, the system can fetch relevant knowledge from a larger corpus (e.g., code documentation, vulnerability databases) and generate more accurate, context-aware responses.

    Automated Evaluation Methods:
        Metrics: Regular evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and other metrics ensures the model is functioning optimally for code vulnerability detection.
        Benchmarking Automation: The system is set to run evaluations automatically, with feedback loops to ensure continual improvements and adjustment based on changing datasets.

Conclusion:

This Python code framework allows you to fine-tune LLMs specifically for code analysis, implement RAG pipelines for context-based insights, and automatically evaluate and benchmark model performance. The combination of these components ensures that the system remains accurate and up-to-date, which is essential for applications like vulnerability detection in code.
